# Arma 3 Dedicated Server

This is a docker image for hosting an Arma 3 dedicated server. It is forked from [mylesgray's image]((https://github.com/mylesagray/Arma3Server)). This fork was made because headless clients were broken in the forked project, and as such this fork fixes that issue. No other major changes were made.

## Usage

### Docker CLI

```s
    docker run \
        --name arma3server \
        -p 2302:2302/udp \
        -p 2303:2303/udp \
        -p 2304:2304/udp \
        -p 2305:2305/udp \
        -p 2306:2306/udp \
        -v path/to/arma3:/arma3/ \
        --env-file ".env" \
        --restart unless-stopped \
        ghcr.io/flufflesamy/arma3server:latest
```

### docker-compose

Use the docker-compose.yml file inside a folder. It will automatically create an "arma3" folder in which the missions, configs, mods and servermods can be loaded into their respective subfolders.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`, containing at least `STEAM_USER`.

Rename `arma3/configs/main.cfg.example` to `main.cfg` and configure it to your liking.

Use `docker-compose start` to start the server.

Use `docker-compose logs` to see server logs.

Use `docker-compose down` to shutdown the server.

The `network_mode: host` can be changed to explicit ports if needed.

Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the server, detached.

See [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) for an installation guide.

Profiles are saved in `/arma3/configs/profiles`

`-e ARMA_CDLC="csla;gm;vn;ws"`

### A note on S.O.G. Prairie Fire Headless Clients

There is a bug in the S.O.G. Prairie Fire CDLC which causes headless clients to crash on launch. This appears to be caused by the way the main menu UI is created (the headless client has no screen resolution, which causes divide by zero errors. To get around this on my own servers I use the below Steam Workshop asset (I'm not providing an endorse and do not have any association with the asset or its creators).

## Loading mods

### Local

1. Place the mods inside `arma3/mods` or `arma3/servermods`.
2. Be sure that the mod folder is all lowercase and does not show up with quotation marks around it when listing the directory eg `'@ACE(v2)'`
3. Run the following command from the mods and/or servermods directory to confirm that all the files are lowercase.
    `find . -depth -exec rename 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;`
    If this is NOT the case, the mods will prevent the server from booting. (The server _should_ run it automatically while starting)
4. Make sure that each mod contains a lowercase `/addons` folder. This folder also needs to be lowercase in order for the server to load the required PBO files inside.
5. Start the server.

### Workshop

Set the environment variable `MODS_PRESET` to the HTML preset file exported from the Arma 3 Launcher. The path can be local file or a URL.

`-e MODS_PRESET="my_mods.html"`

`-e MODS_PRESET="http://example.com/my_mods.html"`

## Discord bot

To use the discord bot and get status updates in your preferred server and channel, you need to create an Application in Discords [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

After doing so you need to create a bot for that application and copy the created Token into your .envs `DISCORD_TOKEN`. Now head over to `OAuth2\URL Generator` and create a URL asking for `bot` permissions `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Send Messages` and `Manage Messages`.

Via the generated url you can now invite the bot to your preferred server, check out the provided functions using `!help`.

## TODO

* Rebase image to a newer version of Debian
